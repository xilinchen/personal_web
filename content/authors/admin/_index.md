I'm a data scientist with expertise in healthcare research. I enjoy learning new data analysis techniques, solving analytic challenges, and creating interpretatble visualization.

I'm originally from [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu) and moved to the U.S. for my master's degree. My career has been majorly focus on healthcare related research including substance abuse, trauma transportation and surgical education. I found working in healthcare research very challenging and fulfilling! Today I am a statistician for the [Center for Surgical Training and Research](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/surgery/news/archive/201903/center-surgical-training-research) at the University of Michigan.

My first name is pronounced "She-lynn". In my free time, I enjoy going for walks, gardening, cooking and trying new restaurants!
