I am an data analyst with expertise in healthcare research. I enjoy working in an interdisciplinary team and solving various data challenges!

I'm originally from Chengdu, Sichuan, China and moved to the U.S. for my master's degree. My career is majorly focus on Healthcare field. I have worked in substance abuse, trauma transportation and surgical education research. I found working in healthcare research very interesting, challenging and fulfilling.

Today I am a Statistician a.k.a. 'big data analyst' for the Center for Surgical Training and Research. I work with Dr. Brian George to analyze surgeon performance and career outcomes. We use data including medicare, EMR and resident preforming evaluation data to develop evidence based training standards for our future surgeons. I have challenges every day and learned a lot from data visualization to modeling techniques.

In my free time, I enjoy walking, gardening and cooking!
