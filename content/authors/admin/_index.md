I'm a data analyst with expertise in healthcare research. I enjoy working in an interdisciplinary team and solving data challenges!

I'm originally from [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu) and moved to the U.S. for my master's degree. My career has been majorly focus on healthcare related research. I have worked in substance abuse, trauma transportation and surgical education research. I found working in healthcare research very interesting, challenging and fulfilling. Today I am a statistician for the Center for Surgical Training and Research at the University of Michigan.

My first name is pronounced as "She-lynn". In my free time, I enjoy walking, gardening and cooking!
