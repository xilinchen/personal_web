<p>I recently went to apple picking on a sunny weekend. Fall in Michigan especially around this time is very beautiful. Going to apple picking is a nice activity to enjoy the fall foliage in the country and get some workout by working and picking the apples.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wasemfruitfarm.com/">apple pick farm</a> I went was pretty nice. I loved their warm donuts, despite there was a wait. The minimum apples to purchase was to fill a half <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushel">bushel</a>! It is A LOT apples!</p>
<p>Here are some things I did/plan to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat an apple a day for a week during lunch</li>
<li>Bring a bag to work to share with coworkers</li>
<li>Give a bag to the neighbor</li>
<li>Cook them!</li>
</ul>
<p>some cooking recopies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/skillet-pork-chops-with-apples-and-onions/">Pork Chop with Apple and Onion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I used 4 Pork Chop (the kind that doesnâ€™t have bones) and 2 big apples</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/268029/chef-johns-apple-butter/">Apple Butter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I liked this idea and recipe. I have never had apple butter, but it does tastes very good. Since I eat a toast for breakfast basically everyday, so I can definitely see the use of this butter!</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 pounds of apples (around 12 apples, I used a mix of all the apples I have) </br></li>
<li>3/4 cup of white sugar and half cup of brown sugar </br></li>
<li>one tsp cinnamon, one tsp salt, half tsp nutmeg, half tsp allspice </br></li>
<li>1/4 cup of apple vinegar</li>
</ul>
